## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- VS Code

### What I Learned

- Learned more about Flexbox and how to properly use it when styling/forming a webpage.
- Was able to understand media quieries a little more and how they shape your responsive layout.

### Continued Development

- Add the images for each card.
